DOM provides tree like structure that all pages should follow

- trees allow for tests
- prove valid or invalid

- Root of tree is html

doctype, head (metadata), body

meta - lang, title, charset, -- not displayed

browser also uses js, css and add ons

body tag is bulk of page

Well-formed pages use the DOM Structure
- use beginning and end tags
- close inner tags before outer ones
- use valid attributes

Browsers will fix bad cade but not well, use a validator to check your code.

- sometimes the site looks ok, use a validator to check the code. 


TAGS

<h1> Hello World </h1> 
beginning.       end

<img src ="x.gif"/>.   : self closing tag
     attribute

- always specified in start tage and come in a name/value pair.



BLOCK and INLINE  Display tags
_______________________________


Block - can take width and height

Inline - only take up as much space as needed. 


headings, paragraph, div are block tags. 

H tags have syntax and semantics
     - semantics is that the <h> tags show importance not FONT or STYLE.

<p> tags 
- only contain other inline elements. 
- never put <p> in a <p> or a heading


div - larger than a paragraph, related elements, no semantic meaning. No extra meaning given. 


List tags. 

<ol> and <ul>

<li> list items
end list items before you close the ol or ul. 


line break
<br> 

- self closing. 
- when you take code, 


Images. 
-------

- are inline
- rarely work the first time, 
- alt allows txt if image will not work.
- save yourself the stress and size and carefully name the picture before you use it. 


<image src ="logo.jpg" alt ="company logo" title ="SpaceMonkey" class ="thumbnail" />

alt is for screen readers and broken link info
title displays on mouse hover
class - gives extra formatting info.

some tags have specific attributes.
 
- class : applies special properties to groups of elements. 
- id : specific element on a page. (unique)
- style: applies visual style, older attribute.
- accesskey - shortcut key to put into focus an element. 
- tabindex - the order elements will come into focus using the tab key. 

High tab indexs are lower numbers. - 1 is a really high index and has high priority. 

Special Entities :
escape characters and codes. 


Semantic tags:
---------------

Newer HTML5 tags

The design of the website is the "DESIGN"


<header> </header>

- it is a block tag
- it does let the user know that this is the header section
- With screen readers this will show
